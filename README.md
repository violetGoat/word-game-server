## A Wordle-Clone Back-End

This the backend for my rendition of Wordle, a modern classic. The project (front-end) can be viewed and played here:

[Word Game Web](http://www.violetgoat.com)

This is a simple API to provide (and later validate) words for the front-end of my Wordle Clone. 

## Development Notes

### Languages
This backend/server was developed in Java using Spring Boot using a simple DAO/Model/Controller design. 

### Future Plans
At some future date (famous last words, I know), I plan for this API to provide word-validation for the Wordle app (or other word-consuming clients). 
For now, Heroku's hobby/free hosting service will only allow 10,000 rows, which is far fewer than the number of words I would want to allow as "valid".
